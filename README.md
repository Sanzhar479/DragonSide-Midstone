Early version of our Capstone project at Humber college.
“Dragon side”. Is a single-player story-driven, action RPG 
with the pixelated art style. It will also include fighting scenes; they will consist of fast 
manoeuvring and dashing between groups of enemies. The main inspiration for this game is 
“Undertale” by James Fox. The main character is a dragon girl without legs and arms. 
Instead, she has artificial limbs that will help her during the fight. The storyline will be the 
main focus of this game and exploring the world. With character, you will open the new 
world. Characters will grow through the timeline and continuously change her appearance 
and views on the world and people.
